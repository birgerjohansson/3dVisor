# 3dVisor
This is the Visor_frame_SWEDEN_v10.stl from Faceshield.nu devided into two parts for printing on an old Makerbot Replicator 2. 

We have produced 3d visor using the orginal model. To increase the production, we modified to be able to fit it on a small build plate. The visor is printed in two parts and snapped together.

The model may not be suitable for strict demands and environments such as hospitals, instead use the the orginal from Faceshield.nu.

The printing time takes forever and the model may need adjustments for other 3d printers. 

Printing settings in Autodesk Print Studio
Standard with raft and 3 ... and 5 % infill.

We ended up NOT using this model.
1. It takes a lot of time.
2. It has more places that can be harder to clean.
3. The original model works!

I was asked to share this model to support others wanting to create visors for small printers. Here it is - with issues descibed too.
